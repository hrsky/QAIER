Every Benchmark has three file:
   respectively are normal, in priority and weight.
CHEBI benchmark:
   the first number in file name means the number of chemical classes an molecule and the second number represent the number of TBox rules which cause inconsistent, where 2 means 3 rules and 3 means 5.
LUBM benchmark:
   the first number in file name means the size of ABox and second number represent the number of TBox rules which cause inconsistent, where 2 means 3 rules and 3 means 5.
LUBM TBox:
   There are two kinds of TBox and their priority and weight versions.
